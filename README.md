# Phase-1-Project

# Overview
Our company is expanding into the aviation industry, with plans to purchase and operate aircraft for both commercial and private use. To mitigate potential risks, we need to identify which aircraft types present the lowest risk for this new venture. This analysis will guide the decision-making process by providing data-driven insights into the safety records of various aircraft. Our findings will be translated into actionable business recommendations, ensuring that the company makes informed decisions in entering this new market.
# Business Understanding
The company is entering the aviation industry, which involves significant risk management, especially in terms of aircraft safety. The main goal is to identify low-risk aircraft models that are safe for both commercial and private operations. To achieve this, data-driven insights are essential to understand the historical safety performance of different aircraft types, models, and manufacturers.
# Key Business Objectives:
Risk Assessment of Aircraft: Analyze historical data on aircraft accidents and incidents to identify models with high and low safety records.
Informed Decision-Making: Provide data-backed recommendations on which aircraft models are safest for purchase and operation.
Cost and Risk Minimization: Avoid potential costs related to accidents, incidents, insurance, and reputational damage by selecting safer aircraft.
# Key Questions to Answer:
1. Which aircraft models have been involved in the highest number of accidents and incidents?
This helps identify which aircraft should be avoided due to their poor safety record.
2. Which aircraft have the highest number of fatalities or injuries?
Fatalities and injuries are critical indicators of risk severity.
3. What is the trend in accident frequency over time?
Understanding whether accident rates for particular aircraft are improving or worsening can help assess future risks.
4. What are the common causes of accidents for each aircraft model?
This can provide insights into whether issues are manufacturer-related, maintenance-related, or due to pilot error, helping to focus on avoidable risks.
6. Are there any aircraft with a consistently low number of accidents over time?
This identifies potential "safe" aircraft to focus on for purchase consideration.
7. How does the number of engines or engine type affect the risk?
Some types of engines or engine configurations might be more prone to failure or accidents.
# Analysis Strategy:
1. Accident Rate per Aircraft Model: Calculate the number of accidents per aircraft model, normalized by the number of planes in operation or total flights.
2. Fatalities and Injuries by Aircraft: Sum total fatalities and injuries associated with each aircraft model to assess their severity.
3. Trend Analysis: Track accidents over time for specific aircraft to determine whether there are any improving or worsening trends.
4. Outlier Analysis: Identify outliers in the accident and incident data to spot exceptionally high-risk aircraft models.
6. Engine Type Analysis: Assess whether certain engine types (e.g., jet engines vs. propellers) have a higher correlation with accidents or incidents.

# Data Understanding & Analysis
# Source of Data
   This dataset is from the National Transportation Safety Board. It was downloaded from Kaggle.com
# Dataset Description:
It includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.
# Data Analysis
The figure below shows the accident trends over the years. This is to give you a perspective of how the trends of accidents on whether they have increased or decrease overtime. As a business owner you don't need to venture into a high increase risk business.

# Conclusion
Based on the analysis,
- It is important to avoid high-risk aircraft with a history of frequent accidents and high fatality rates.
- I recommend aircraft with a strong safety record and a low number of incidents for purchase.
- Consider the engine type and number of engines when making purchasing decisions, as they might contribute to operational risks.
- These insights will enable the head of the new aviation division to make an informed decision, minimize potential risks, and ensure the company makes a profitable and safe entry into the aviation market.
